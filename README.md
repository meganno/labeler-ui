## For UI development
- Clone and [create your own branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)
- Under **root** folder
  - Run `pip install -e .`
- Under **/js** folder
  - Run `npm install`
  - Run `npm run watch`: this automatically rebundles JS components for you; then restart the notebook to test
- [Submit pull-request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to `stage` branch
  - `stage` branch is a **development** branch.
  - `main` branch is a **production** branch.
  
P.S. Periodically delete JS files created by labeler-ui under `/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/idom-jupyter/` (run `whoami` to get username from the terminal [macOS])
